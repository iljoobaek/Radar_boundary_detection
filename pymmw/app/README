In config file, this line will be modified to fit the need.

>>> profileCfg 0 77 219 7 89.92 0 0 6 1 512 6250 0 0 30

1. To adjust the max range to be higher, change the "6" to smaller. Otherwise higher.
   When max range goes up, the resolution will decrease.

   Maximum is 44, with 4 chirps per frame.

2. To adjust the resolution, adjust 512 to higher. (but 512 is the largest for this hardware)
   But at the same time calculate the correct number and file it in the "89.92"

   for example, 512 samples / 6250 * 1000 = 81.92 us.
   Then add the 81.92 with 7 us and 1 us = 89.92 us.

3. Yet the samples in 2. cannot be too large since the memory on chip is limited.
   If the memory is not enough, the module will fail with main.c line 2177,
   indicating that the malloc of radar cube fails.

4. To adjust the max velocity, change the 219 to smaller.
   To adjust for better velocity resolution, change the 219 to higher.


Another line potentially needs to be changed:

>>> frameCfg 0 1 4 0 333.333 1 0

The 4 here is the chirp per frame, namely Doppler bins. The number couldn't be too large
since the memory of radar cube will be too large, causing exception on datapath.c line 937 or around.
(the real chirps per frame shown on GUI is 4 * 2 = 8. Not sure why.)

8 is maximum for 512 samples. And the larger the better velocity resolution.
